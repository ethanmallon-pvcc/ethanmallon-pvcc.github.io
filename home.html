    <h2>What do these actions mean for the US Title Code?</h2>
    <h3>Repeal</h3>
    <ul><li>"Repealed" is the moniker used to refer to the rescission of existing law. Specifically, repeal occurs when the relevant law is removed via the creation of subsequent legislation or amendment. An example of a repeal can be found in Chapter 1 of Title 50, where a portion of the Chapter was "overwritten." This was due to the original language of the Chapter placing salary limitations on Council of National Defense officers and employees. This was amended on September 6, 1966 by Public Law 89-554.</li></ul>
    <h3>Omission</h3>
    <ul><li>"Omitted" is the term used to refer to any statutory text that has been removed, but for reasons other than repeal. In short, omitted text means that the relevant text has been amended out of existence because it is or was obsolete, expired, or otherwise terminated. However, for recordkeeping purposes, information regarding omitted material is usually contained in a Codification note attached to that section of legislature. Chapter 9 - AIRCRAFT had multiple omissions placed on it. Sections 151 - 151f of this Chapter were omitted due to them being written regarding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. When this Committee was terminated and it's functions, powers, duties, and obligations were transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the leftover legislature became obsolete since the government body these sections were written for no longer existed. Thus they were formally omitted along with other sections of the Chapter. </li></ul>
    <h3>Transfer</h3>
    <ul><li>The term "Transferred" is fairly simple to understand; a transferred Chapter or SubChapter is one that has been removed from its original place in legislature to a new one. This movement can range from being placed in a different Chapter to being placed in an entirely different Title. Sections 1451-1454 of Chapter 30 regarding State enactment of absentee voting legislations, balloting procedures, statistical data, and legislation regarding personnel residing on military installations was moved to section 1973 of Title 42 - Public Health and Welfare. In fact, sections 1451-1453 were formerly sections 2171-2173 of Title 5 before being transferred during the Title's revision and enactment.</li></ul>
